# mutation_rate_drake
This does the calculation from "A constant rate of spontaneous mutation in
DNA-based microbes" http://www.pnas.org/content/88/16/7160.full.pdf

Program input is the path to a csv with the columns: 'name', 'f' and 'N'
Output is a csv with the columns: 'name', 'f', 'N' and 'u'
f = mutant frequency
N = population size
u = mutation rate per replication
